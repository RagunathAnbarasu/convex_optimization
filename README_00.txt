The Sensor selection simulation problem is simulated using Matlab (R2019a).

System Requirements :	Windows/Linux based
			Matlab (R2019a) or higher
			CVX Version 2.2 (Stable). Please not CVX Version 3.0 is not recommended. 

Simulation procedure:
			1.Both matlab files (cvx_sensor_selection_multiple.m, getInducedV.m) are to be placed inside a single folder
			2.Open cvx_sensor_selection_multiple.m in Matlab.
			3.To simulate the problem use the Run program button from the editor tool box.
			4.Select change to folder path in the pop-up window.
